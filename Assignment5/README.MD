# Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
-----------------------------------------------------
# Student Marks Lookup (Python)

This program demonstrates how to use a **Python dictionary** to store and retrieve student marks.

---

## 📋 How It Works
1. A dictionary named `student` is created, mapping student names to their marks:
   student = {'Rahul': 85, 'Shubham': 96, 'Alice': 85}
The program asks the user to enter a student’s name.

It checks if the entered name exists in the dictionary:

If found, it prints the marks.

If not found, it prints "Student not found.".

▶️ Example Run
Case 1: Student exists
Enter the student's name: Shubham
Shubham's marks: 96
Case 2: Student does not exist
Enter the student's name: John
Student not found.

# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing 
----------------------------------------------------
# List Slicing and Reversing (Python)

This program demonstrates how to:
- Create a list of numbers.
- Extract a portion of the list using slicing.
- Reverse the extracted elements.

---

## 📋 How It Works
1. A list of numbers from 1 to 10 is defined.
2. The first five elements are extracted using slicing:  
   extracted = list[0:5]
This takes elements from index 0 to 4 (inclusive).
3. The extracted sublist is reversed using:
extracted.reverse()
The results are printed.

▶️ Example Run
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five element: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
